       <p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
       <p>We are a group of high school students from El Segundo High School who want to use their four years of knowledge from our engineering course
         in order to solve a problem.</p>
        <p><strong>What problem are we trying to solve?</strong></p>
        <p>We want to reduce the amount of trash that is not properly disposed.  We believe that the problem starts
        with the people because they are the producers of such waste.</p>
        <p><strong>Why is this a problem?</strong></p>  
        <p>Trash that is not properly disposed can be a hazard to both the environment and those who inhabit it.</p>
        <p><strong>How are we going to fix it?</strong></p>  
        <p>We velieve that the reason people do not dispose trash properly is because they have no incentive to do so.  Therefore,
          if we create some motive for people to throw trash away, then there would be a reduced amount of trash.</p>
        <p><strong>Where do we start?</strong></p>  
        <p>Through much research, we found a program that tries to prove our same idea known as "The Fun Thoery."  They
          are known for their study of human decisions.  If by simply adding fun to an activity they would not normally
          do, then they will do it.  They have muiltple tests, but the ones that caught our groups attention was the
          <p>"The Bottle Bank Arcade Machine"</p>

          <p>"The World's Deepest Bin."</p>
          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cbEKAwCoCKw?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  
          </p>
          <p><strong>If these ideas worked so well, then why try to fix what already works?</strong></p>  
          <p>The problem with both of these solutions is that it lacks efficiency as they use too much power. 
            These solutions were only meant for single day purposes, where we want to make a long lasting product.
